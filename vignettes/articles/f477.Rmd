FCC was reporting on Form 477 about Fixed Broadband deployement. 
Broadband providers were required to fill this form: 

> All facilities-based broadband providers are required to file data with the FCC twice a year (Form 477) on where they offer Internet access service at speeds exceeding 200 kbps in at least one direction.  
Fixed providers file lists of census blocks in which they can or do offer service to at least one location, with additional information about the service.

**NOTE**
A provider is just required to tell if he provides a specific services in a block and is not required to provide how much in that block he is covering with it.

> **Fixed** providers file lists of census blocks in which they can or do offer service to at least one location, with additional information about the service.

## Our opinionated version: a good data storytelling start with a good data history

This is a complicated data set that have seen change in its structure and can have multiple versions per release. 

We were only interested in *Fixed without satellite* data. 

We also took the decision to only use and ingest the last release of each version.
